CRUD Operation in firebase :
First basic step is to import firestore is Firebase initialize file and then create a db using firestore function.
This db created allows access to the database can be said that it points to the database.
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
const db = getFirestore()
export db;
1)Writing :
->In order to create a document in the firebase collection we have to first import {collection} from "firebase/firestore"
which will provide access to the collections present in your database.
->Also we have to use {addDoc} to add document to the collections.
->Here the addDoc method takes two arguments one is reference to the collection in which the data is to be added and second the data object to be added

eg : 
in this project =>
const collectionref = collection(db,"users");
addDoc(collectionref,{});

2)Reading:
->Here we have {getDocs} method which will give the docs present in the collecion provided as the input in the function.
getDocs(collectionref).then(data => data.JSON()).then()
